    <<~EOS
      Start it once; it copies itself to /Applications (or ~/Applications) and runs from there:
        open "#{opt_prefix}/AWS AutoConnect.app"
      After `brew upgrade`, the copy updates itself the next time it starts.
      `brew uninstall` leaves that copy of AWS AutoConnect.app; delete it by hand.

      For the VPN, open the VPN tab and click "Install Helper…" (asks for your admin password once).
